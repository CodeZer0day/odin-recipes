        <p>Shawarma is a popular Middle Eastern street food made by stacking thin slices of marinated meat (usually chicken, beef, or lamb) on a vertical rotisserie, which slowly turns and cooks the meat evenly. As the outer layer cooks, it is shaved off into thin strips and served hot. The marinade usually includes spices like cumin, paprika, turmeric, garlic, and sometimes yogurt or vinegar, giving the meat a rich, smoky, and tangy flavor.</p><p>It is commonly served in pita bread, wraps, or flatbreads, stuffed with the shaved meat along with vegetables such as lettuce, onions, tomatoes, pickles, and often drizzled with tahini, garlic sauce, or hummus. Shawarma has become a global favorite because of its bold flavors, juicy meat, and versatility, making it both a quick street snack and a hearty meal.</p>

        <h1>Honey cake</h1>

        <p>Ukraine Honey Cake, also known as Medovik, is a traditional layered dessert cherished across Eastern Europe. 
            The cake is made with thin, soft layers of honey-infused sponge that are stacked together and filled with a rich 
            cream made from sour cream, whipped cream, or condensed milk. Over time, the cream soaks into the cake layers, 
            making them tender and giving the dessert a melt-in-the-mouth texture. 
            Its flavor is a perfect balance of honey sweetness with a slight tang from the creamy filling.
        </p>
        <p>This cake is not only popular for its taste but also for its cultural value, 
           often prepared during festive occasions, family gatherings, and celebrations in Ukraine. 
           While recipes can vary from household to household, the essence remains the same—multiple delicate layers bound together with luscious cream, creating a dessert that feels both light and indulgent. 
           Today, Medovik is enjoyed worldwide, but it continues to hold a special place in Ukrainian culinary tradition

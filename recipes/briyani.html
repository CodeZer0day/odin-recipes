        <img src="../images/briyani.jpeg" height="178" width="283" alt="Dish briyani">
        <p>Biryani is a fragrant and flavorful rice dish made by layering aromatic basmati rice with marinated meat (such as chicken, mutton, beef, or fish), vegetables, and a blend of rich spices like cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, and saffron. It is often slow-cooked to allow the flavors to infuse deeply, creating a rich taste and irresistible aroma. Depending on the region, biryani can be prepared in different styles—such as Hyderabadi, Lucknowi, Malabar, or Kolkata—each with its unique touch in spices, preparation methods, and accompaniments.</p>
        <p>More than just food, biryani is a cultural symbol across South Asia and the Middle East, representing celebration, hospitality, and tradition. It is commonly served at weddings, festivals, and family gatherings, often enjoyed with side dishes like raita (yogurt dip), salan (spicy curry), or boiled eggs. Its richness, complexity, and comfort make biryani one of the most beloved dishes worldwide, cherished not only for its taste but also for the way it brings people together.</p>

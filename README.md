<strong>Project Summary</strong>

This project is part of <strong>The Odin Project Foundations course</strong> and focuses on building a simple recipe website. The goal is to practice creating multiple web pages, linking them together, and displaying information in a clean, structured format. Each page contains a recipe with ingredients, steps, and images. This project helped me get comfortable with writing semantic HTML and organizing content for the web.

<strong>Tools & Technologies Used</strong>

<ul>
   <li>HTML5 → for building the structure of the web pages</li>
   <li>Git & GitHub → for version control and publishing the project online.</li>
   <li>VS Code → as the main text editor for writing and organizing code.</li>
   <li>Linux (Ubuntu) → as my working environment.</li>
</ul>

<strong>What I Learned</strong>

Through this project, I learned how to structure HTML documents properly using headings, paragraphs, lists, and images. I also practiced using relative links to connect multiple pages, which is an essential skill for building websites. Additionally, I gained experience in using Git for tracking changes and GitHub for hosting, which are important tools for any developer
